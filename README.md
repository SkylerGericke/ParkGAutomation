Plan of work: 

The plan of work will start with determining either a system design, class hierarchy, or specific questions by the customer and write methods to tackle the questions. The system design will focus on how to approach the problems that arise and clarify any assumptions. It is the team’s job to handle the ambiguity of the problem through a systematic approach to answer the questions that will ultimately arise. Some questions that must be answered are: How is the parking lot designed? Is it a building or an open space? How is the parking lot accessed? Is there more than one exit/entrance? What is the capacity of the parking lot (i.e. number of parking spots)? 
No matter what type of parking lot, the focus of the work will be on building some type of website interface for customers that will park their cars in the parking lot, a website or app for the valet to know which spots are open, a database that will store statistics and trends, and possibly an application that will interact with cameras and hardware components of the parking lot. Most likely the work will require expertise in HTML, CSS, and javascript for the website interfaces. Java and python may be needed for the application that will interact with hardware components. MySQL and PHP would be required for the database and back end portion of the project.
James Choi is currently experienced in usage of HTML, CSS, javascript, and Java. He is concurrently taking a class covering MySQL and may be able to assist on the back-end portion.
The team size is 5 and this is adequate to tackle the workload over the course of 3-4 months. The estimate for the preliminary cost would depend on how much manpower hours are contributed towards the software requirements. For example, if the parking lot is primarily automated with a conveyor belt and elevator/lift system with very little human interaction needed, there will be much greater manpower hours to design the software systems to cover all the hardware aspects. There would also entail more of a need for safety for a fully automated parking lot because there must be built in fail safes into the system in case of malfunctions. Based on projected workload of 10 hours per week x 16 weeks in semester x 5 team members = 800 hours invested into project. Give or take some will invest more time than others on the team, the range can be 600-1000 hours invested into the project. This manpower hour figure can be further clarified using some statistical formula to give a more accurate representation further into the semester. Since the team members are not full-fledged entry level workers yet, we may command more of an intern’s average salary of 18 dollars an hour (based off indeed.com figures). Therefore, we arrive at 18 x 800 hours = $14,400. However, the company that we intern at for this project will have to charge a higher multiple of this cost to cover the overhead costs like healthcare, benefits, and workspace, etc. Assuming the team knows what they are doing and not getting in over their heads, it would not be a far stretch to give a premium to their services for the end user of the finished product. Therefore, let us place the preliminary estimate of the costs to be $100,000-$300,000.
Our team will know that we have succeeded in this project if we create value for the customer by coming in under budget and manpower hours consumed. Furthermore, we will know the project is a success if we significantly reduce the ambiguity of the diagnosed problem. This can be accomplished through requirements gathering from structured system design, along with requirements analysis and specifications developed through user stories.
